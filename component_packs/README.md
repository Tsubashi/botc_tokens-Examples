# Component Packs
In this folder you will find a number of pre-build component packs that you can use in your projects. While we have
tried to make each consistent and usable as they are, feel free to use them as starting points and modify them to fit
you own ideas. Each pack is made from original work and is licensed under 
[CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

## How to use
When running the `create` command, you can specify the pack you want to use by adding the `--components` option. 
For example:
```bash
botc_tokens create --components=pack_name
```

Where `pack_name` is the name of the pack you want to use. If you don't specify a pack, the default pack will be used.
