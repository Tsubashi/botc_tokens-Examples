# Component Packs
In this folder you will find a number of pre-build component packs that you can use in your projects. While we have
tried to make each consistent and usable as they are, feel free to use them as starting points and modify them to fit
you own ideas. Each pack is made from original work and is licensed under 
[CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

## How to use
To use a pack, first download the matching zip file. From there, you can use the `botc_tokens` command line tool to 
create tokens using the pack. When running the `create` command, you can specify the pack you want to use by adding 
the `--components` option. For example:
```bash
botc_tokens create --components=/path/to/downloded/pack.zip
```
Make sure to replace `/path/to/downloded/pack.zip` with the path of the pack you downloaded. 
If you don't specify a pack, the default pack will be used.
